abstract: How are candidates without official party affiliation able to succeed
  in authoritarian elections? We analyzed 1,101 independents who took part in
  city council elections in Russia’s regional capitals between 2014 and 2018. We
  found that independent candidates’ electoral fortunes depended both on their
  personal resources enabling them to attract voters’ support and pre-electoral
  deals with the regime. We also discovered that the chances of being elected
  were higher for those formally independent candidates who were the regime’s
  hidden representatives. For the latter group, the chances to win the race were
  boosted mostly by pre-electoral deals, rather than their personal resources.
